In a previous role, I faced a challenge with a payment provider that was causing discrepancies in the balance sheet. After investigating, I discovered the issue was with the way PayPal was settling their transactions. I queried the database to investigate all transactions for the concerned period. After a while, myself and a developer found the 2 transactions causing the discrepancy and the issue was resolved.
