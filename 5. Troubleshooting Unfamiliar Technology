I would start by researching the framework or technology to understand its basics. Then, I would ask the customer the following questions:

What specific issue are you facing?
Can you provide error messages or logs?
What steps have you already taken to troubleshoot the issue?
Can you share the relevant parts of your code?
What environment are you running this on (e.g., local, staging, production)?
